The pressure of an ideal gas at constant temperature varies inversely with the volume
A fundamental principle of electrostatics; the force of attraction or repulsion between two charged particles is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the distance between them; principle also holds for magnetic poles

(physics) the law that states any two bodies attract each other with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them
(chemistry) the law that states the following principle: the rate of a chemical reaction is directly proportional to the molecular concentrations of the reacting substances
(chemistry) law stating that when two elements can combine to form more than one compound the amounts of one of them that combines with a fixed amount of the other will exhibit a simple multiple relation
(physics) a law governing the relations between states of energy in a closed system
(genetics) one of two principles of heredity formulated by gregor mendel on the basis of his experiments with plants; the principles were limited and modified by subsequent genetic research

Pressure applied anywhere to a body of fluid causes a force to be transmitted equally in all directions; the force acts at right angles to any surface in contact with the fluid
No two electrons or protons or neutrons in a given system can be in states characterized by the same set of quantum numbers
(chemistry) the principle that chemical properties of the elements are periodic functions of their atomic numbers
(physics) the basis of quantum theory; the energy of electromagnetic waves is contained in indivisible quanta that have to be radiated or absorbed as a whole; the magnitude is proportional to frequency where the constant of proportionality is given by planck's constant
(physics) an equation that expresses the distribution of energy in the radiated spectrum of an ideal black body
A rule or law concerning a natural phenomenon or the function of a complex system
